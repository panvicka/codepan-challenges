# CodePen challenges

I have joined the CodePen weekly challenges and I am having a lot of fun. I am always trying to think outside of the box and come with something original, interactive and fun! Also to improve my JS, Typescript and CSS skils.
The repo has some opened issues and features ideas, so feel free to contribute if you feel like it.
